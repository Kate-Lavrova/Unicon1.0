1 Introduction
Project Name: Unit Converter (Unicon1.0).
This application will make transfers from one unit to another. Units will include: Length, Temperature, Volume,  Area, Speed, Digital Storage. 


2 User Requirements
2.1 Software Interfaces
This application does not require interaction with some extra serves, or databases.

2.2 User Interfaces
The user interface will be presented in the form of one of the main window, where we will select the top of the
category relevant to translation units (length, temperature, volume, area, speed, memory, weight). Clicking a category we needed, we will see at the bottom of the window is a list of available values ​​for translation in this category.
For example: selecting the temperature we see at the bottom line to: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin. If we want to make a transfer, we will introduce one of the fields (in fact from which I want to become to translate) the value of digital! If we introduce the letter, then we pop up a warning errors that input is possible only digits! Comment! The user is allowed to perform only one operation at a time, and then clear the results, run another Operation of. If we introduce a time 2 digital values ​​in the two fields, the application will be taken as a basic value of that which is to be ahead of others (above). I mean, the conversion from the top down by priority.
Downstairs there is also the "transfer" and "clean".

2.3 User Characteristics
This application is suitable for all user groups. But it will be the most in demand among students and
specialists in diversified industry work (engineers, biologists, chemists).

2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
The program has no requirements that could not implement any modern computer.

3 System Requirements
3.1 Functional Requirements
  1) This application will offer a variety of categories of measured values to convert.
  2) Selecting a category will be a selection of a particular measurement value (out of ) and enter a numerical value.
  3) User should have possibility to move from one category to another, choose different value and numerical to convert.

3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
3.2.1 SOFTWARE QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
The application converts a number from one type to the other variables:
1) Reliability:
This application should not cause any errors in the conversion, as well as the wrong type.
2) Accuracy:
If there should be no transfer of any errors, the result should be accurate.
